# Research at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)

This project was conducted during a Summer Undergraduate Research Program in Summer 2022 where I researched robotics used for biomedical purposes, as well as Deep Learning algorithms to localize targetted areas in soft tissues. The final paper (also published on MDPI) is provided, along with all the references used.
