This experience was done during High School (2017-2018) at College Louise Wegmann (Beirut, Lebanon), as part of the French Baccalaureate's "TPE" (Travaux Pratiques Encadrés). This one-year-long research project was carried out in a team of 4. I was responsible for the Télémédecine part (or Telemedicine), which involved data transmission in Ultrasound (US) Scanning, data analytics, Robotics used in US Scaning, and Machine Learning (ML) used in Telemedicine. Additionally, we worked on the specific case of the Melanoma Cancer and how to predict it using Artificial Intelligence (AI) as part of our final deliverable. 

### Note that as this was done in high school, we received a lot of help from faculty members to understand advanced concepts in AI, robotics, and other topics that we lacked knowledge in. Additionally, we used a smaller dataset for our final prototype, for simplicity purposes. The ML algorithm was written in Java and used a Map-Reduce algorithm.

### Finally, please note that this project is written in French, as this is a French High School. However, the gist of it can be understood through headings and figures.
