LAB 4 : 
-------

Problem 1: 
----------
Part a


    
    Best case:  no numbers were entered, so Θ(1)
    Worst case: numbers were entered, Θ(n)
    
    
Part b

    Best case: no numbers were entered, so Θ(1)
    Worst case: numbers were entered and sorted, Θ(n)
    
Problem 2:
----------
Part a 
    
    Best case: The word is a letter or the first and last letter are different, Θ(1)
    Worst case: The word is a palindrome, Θ(n/2) --> Θ(n)
    
Part b

    Best case = Worst case ==> Θ(n) internally
    slicing is Θ(n) like if x in L
Problem 3:
----------
Part a 

    Best case: The list is composed of one number, theta = Θ(n^3)  
    Worst case: The list is composed of more number, theta = Θ(n^3)
    
Part b
    
    Best case: theta = Θ(n^3)
    Worst case: theta = Θ(n^3)

Part c
    
    Best case: theta = Θ(n^2)
    Worst case: theta = Θ(n^2)
        Same because there are no conditions that can shorten the program
        
LAB 5:
------
  
Problem 1:
----------
    
    Best case: 
    Worst case: Θ(n)
    
Problem 2:
----------

    Best case: Θ(n^2)
    Worst case: Θ(n^2)
    Selection Sort is n^2
    

LAB 6:
------
  
Problem 2:
----------
    
    Best case:  Θ(n)
    Worst case: Θ(n*m)  m length of word. if negligible --> Θ(n)
