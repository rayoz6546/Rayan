#  PROJECTS

These are some of the most important projects I have had. Some were conducted as part of my academic journey, and others were professional experiences. Video Demos and more are provided!

### Please note that most of these projects were conducted in teams. Therefore, the material (specifically code) provided for most of them consists of only my own work. This decision was made out of respect for my teammates' intellectual property and contributions. Attempts to try and run the codes will hence not be successful as other parts of the systems are needed.
