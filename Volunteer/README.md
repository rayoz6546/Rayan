# Volunteer

This experience was held in 2016-2017, where I collaborated with 3 colleagues to help the Lebanese association "L'Ecoute" that takes care of handicapped children in Lebanon. We organized cupcake sales and put up flyers all around the city of Beirut to give it more recognition and encourage donations. Additionally, we sold customized bracelets with the help of "Arc-en-Ciel", a Lebanese association that supports the country's unpriviledged and marginalizaed communities. We were able to collect 300,000 Lebanese Lira (around 300$ at that time) and secure a leg prosthesis for one child.

## Please note that all the documents are written in French, as this was part of a school project at my high school "College Louise Wegmann" (a French school) in Lebanon.
