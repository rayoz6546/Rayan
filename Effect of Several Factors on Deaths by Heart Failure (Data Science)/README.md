# Data Science Project

This project was conducted during STAT1261 (Principles of Data Science) in Fall 2023, where I studied the effects of several factors on deaths by heart failures alongside 2 teammates. We used multiple Data Visualization and Wrangling techniques in R, and trained several Machine Learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) to find the optimal accuracy.

# Tools and Concepts used 

* R
* RStudio 
* Data Visualization (Histogram, Boxplot, QQ-Plots, Bar Charts, etc.)
* Data Wrangling (filter, select, mutate, sort, summarise, joins, etc.)
* Data Tidying (gather, spread, seperate, unite)
* Sampling and Bootstrap
* Supervised Learning (Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest)
* Parameter Tuning
* Optimization (Accuracy)
* Teamwork
* Communication
* Presentations
