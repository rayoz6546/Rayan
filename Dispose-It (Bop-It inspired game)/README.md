# Dispose It 

This project was conducted during ECE1895 (Junior Design) in Spring 2022. I worked with 2 teammates to design and build a "Bop-It" inspired game called "Dispose It". The device prompts several items that the user has to dispose of correctly by triggering one of three sensors corresponding to the following actions: "Recycle It", "Trash It", and "Compost It". I worked on the Hardware unit of the system which involved creating the PCB, circuitry, and Hardware Testing. The part provided in the "Materials" section is only my own. Video Demo Provided!
