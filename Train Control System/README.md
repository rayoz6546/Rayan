# Train Control System 

This project was conducted during ECE1140 (Project Management) in Spring 2023. I worked in a team of 6 on a train control system, and was responsible for the Wayside/Track Controller (Software). I controlled traffic lights, railway crossings, switch positions, and detected power & circuit failures. All the supporting documents and code (only my own work is shown) are provided. Video Demo as well!
